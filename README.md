## The Protocol
Zombie is a social experiment game, you can see the true side of humanity only at the moment of domination. You only need 1 $BTC and 1 $ZOMBIE when the world is going to end. Zombie is designed to see the true face of your friend and if you understand the rules, you can play to the end.

The $ZOMBIE token combines a simplified version of Ampleforth‚Äôs economic policy with YFI‚Äôs distribution mechanism, finally we added PUBG‚Äôs poison circle mechanism! Do you think your companion will save you?

## The world is shrinking

Do you know who is your true friend? Who can help you when fleeing? We no longer need a bunch of tokens that in defi list, we only need BTC + ZOMBIE. Especially when fleeing...

**~~This time, we will really see a $100 coin~~**


At core, $ZOMBIE is a shrinking-only supply cryptocurrency, which only **contracts** its supply in response to market conditions, initially targeting 100 USD per $ZOMBIE. 

> If the $ZOMBIE price does not reach $100, contracts rebase will be carried out every 24 hours, and after each rebase, **if your account's zombie balace not over then 1 $ZOMBIE, your $ZOMBIE will be permanently burned.**

## Governance
? There is no government, the world is destroyed...


## Audits

None. Contributors have given their best efforts to ensure the security of these contracts, but make no guarantees. It has been spot checked by just a few pairs of eyes. It is a probability - not just a possibility - that there are bugs. That said, minimal changes were made to the staking/distribution contracts that have seen hundreds of millions flow through them via SNX, YFI, and YFI derivatives. The reserve contract is excessively simple as well. We prioritized staked assets' security first and foremost.


If you feel uncomfortable with these disclosures, don't stake or hold Zombie. If the community votes to fund an audit, or the community is gifted an audit, there is no assumption that the original devs will be around to implement fixes, and is entirely at their discretion.
